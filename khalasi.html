                <p>Coke Studio originated in Brazil in 2007 as a unique fusion music project that aimed to blend two contrasting Brazilian artists and their musical styles.[4] Later, Nadeem Zaman, the Marketing Head of The Coca-Cola Company, partnered with Rohail Hyatt, a former member of Vital Signs, to create a Pakistani version of the show. The first season premiered in June 2008 with a live audience but shifted to a closed studio format for subsequent seasons, which remains the show's format to this day.[5]

                    In June 2012, Coke Studio @ MTV, the Indian version of the show, was launched with Leslie Lewis producing the first season[6] and multiple producers for the later seasons.[7][8] The show was a collaboration between Coca-Cola India and MTV India, with MTV India being the official broadcaster for all four seasons.[9]
                    
                    Following the success of the Pakistani and Indian versions, Coke Studio Bangla was launched in Bangladesh in February 2022.[10]
                    
                    In February 2023, Coke Studio resumed its Hindi-language show after an eight-year break, with a new name, Coke Studio Bharat.[11] In the same month, Coke Studio also launched its Tamil-language edition in India called Coke Studio Tamil.</p>
